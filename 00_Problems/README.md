# Class Programming Problems 🏫

Welcome to the **Class Programming Problems** repository! 🚀 This folder contains coding problems and their solutions from our programming course. The focus here is on problem-solving within time constraints, as these exercises are designed to be completed during class sessions.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repository serves as:
- **A Problem Archive:** A collection of problems solved in class.
- **A Learning Resource:** A way to track progress and refine coding techniques.
- **A Practical Challenge:** Solutions are optimized within the given time constraints, making it a great test of efficiency under pressure.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
These solutions are written within a **limited time frame**, so while they are functional and correct, there might be **more optimized approaches**. The focus is on solving the problem efficiently under time constraints rather than finding the most optimal solution.

## 🔧 How to Compile & Run

Follow these steps to compile and run any of the C programs in this folder:

1. **Navigate to the Folder:**
   ```bash
   cd 00_Problems
   ```

2. **Compile a C Program:**
   Example for `03_IntSqrt.c`:
   ```bash
   gcc 3_IntSqrt. -o 3_IntSqrt
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   ./3_IntSqrt
   ```

4. **Additional Notes:**
   - Some programs require user input for execution.

## 🤝 Contributions

Since these problems are **class assignments**, the solutions are my own work. However, if you have insights, alternative approaches, or improvements:

- **Fork the Repository**
- **Create a Feature Branch**
- **Submit a Pull Request** with a detailed explanation of your changes

Collaboration is welcome, but keep in mind the constraints under which these solutions were created. 🚀
